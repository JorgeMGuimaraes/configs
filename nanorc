#    When backing up files, allow the backup to succeed even if its permissions can’t be (re)set due to special OS considerations. You should NOT enable this option unless you are sure you need it.
#set allow_insecure_backup

#    When soft line wrapping is enabled, make it wrap lines at blank characters (tabs and spaces) instead of always at the edge of the screen.
#set atblanks

#    Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of tabs and/or spaces as the previous line (or as the next line if the previous line is the beginning of a paragraph).
set autoindent

#    When saving a file, back up the previous version of it, using the current filename suffixed with a tilde (~).
#set backup

#    Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a uniquely numbered one every time a file is saved — when backups are enabled with set backup or --backup or -B. The uniquely numbered files are stored in the specified directory.
#set backupdir "directory"

#    Use bold instead of reverse video for the title bar, status bar, key combos, function tags, line numbers, and selected text. This is overridden by setting the options titlecolor, statuscolor, keycolor, functioncolor, numbercolor, and/or selectedcolor.
#set boldtext

#    When justifying, treat any line that starts with whitespace as the beginning of a paragraph (unless auto-indenting is on).
#set bookstyle

#    Set the characters treated as closing brackets when justifying paragraphs. This may not include blank characters. Only closing punctuation (see set punct), optionally followed by the specified closing brackets, can end sentences. The default value is ""')>]}".
#set brackets "characters"

#    Automatically hard-wrap the current line when it becomes overlong.
#set breaklonglines

#    Do case-sensitive searches by default.
#set casesensitive

#    Constantly display the cursor position on the status bar. Note that this overrides quickblank.
#set constantshow

#    Use cut-from-cursor-to-end-of-line by default, instead of cutting the whole line.
#set cutfromcursor

#    Do not use the line below the title bar, leaving it entirely blank.
set emptyline

#    Use this color combination for the status bar when an error message is displayed. The default value is brightwhite,red. See set functioncolor for valid color names.
#set errorcolor [bold,][italic,]fgcolor,bgcolor

#    Set the target width for justifying and automatic hard-wrapping at this number of columns. If the value is 0 or less, wrapping will occur at the width of the screen minus number columns, allowing the wrap point to vary along with the width of the screen if the screen is resized. The default value is -8.
#set fill number

#    Use this color combination for the concise function descriptions in the two help lines at the bottom of the screen. Valid names for the foreground and background colors are: red, green, blue, magenta, yellow, cyan, white, and black. Each of these eight names may be prefixed with the word light to get a brighter version of that color. The word grey or gray may be used as a synonym for lightblack.
#    On terminal emulators that can do at least 256 colors, other valid (but unprefixable) color names are: pink, purple, mauve, lagoon, mint, lime, peach, orange, latte, and normal — where normal means the default foreground or background color. Either fgcolor or ,bgcolor may be left out, and the pair may be preceded by bold and/or italic (separated by commas) to get a bold and/or slanting typeface, if your terminal can do those.
#set functioncolor [bold,][italic,]fgcolor,bgcolor


#    Draw a vertical stripe at the given column, to help judge the width of the text. (The color of the stripe can be changed with set stripecolor.)
set guidestripe 80

#    Save the last hundred search strings and replacement strings and executed commands, so they can be easily reused in later sessions.
#set historylog

#    Display a "scrollbar" on the righthand side of the edit window. It shows the position of the viewport in the buffer and how much of the buffer is covered by the viewport.
#set indicator

#    Scroll the buffer contents per half-screen instead of per line.
#set jumpyscrolling

#    Use this color combination for the shortcut key combos in the two help lines at the bottom of the screen. See set functioncolor for valid color names.
#set keycolor [bold,][italic,]fgcolor,bgcolor

#    Display line numbers to the left of the text area. (Any line with an anchor additionally gets a mark in the margin.)
set linenumbers

#    Enable vim-style lock-files for when editing files.
#set locking

#    When neither the file’s name nor its first line give a clue, try using libmagic to determine the applicable syntax. (Calling libmagic can be relatively time consuming. It is therefore not done by default.)
#set magic

#    Specify the opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket searches. This may not include blank characters. The opening set must come before the closing set, and the two sets must be in the same order. The default value is "(<[{)>]}".
#set matchbrackets "characters"

#    Suppress the title bar and instead show information about the current buffer at the bottom of the screen, in the space for the status bar. In this "minibar" the file name is shown on the left, followed by an asterisk if the buffer
#      has been modified. On the right are displayed the current line and column number, the code of the character under the cursor (in Unicode format: U+xxxx), the same flags as are shown by set stateflags, and a percentage that
#      expresses how far the cursor is into the file (linewise). When a file is loaded or saved, and also when switching between buffers, the number of lines in the buffer is displayed after the file name. This number is cleared upon
#      the next keystroke, or replaced with an [i/n] counter when multiple buffers are open. The line plus column numbers and the character code are displayed only when set constantshow is used, and can be toggled on and off with M-C.
#      The state flags are displayed only when set stateflags is used.
set minibar

#    Use this color combination for the minibar. (When this option is not specified, the colors of the title bar are used.) See set functioncolor for valid color names.
#set minicolor [bold,][italic,]fgcolor,bgcolor

#    Enable mouse support, so that mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a double click), or execute shortcuts.
#set mouse

#    When reading in a file with ^R, insert it into a new buffer by default.
#set multibuffer

#    Don’t convert files from DOS/Mac format.
set noconvert

#    Don’t display the help lists at the bottom of the screen.
#set nohelp

#    Don’t automatically add a newline when a text does not end with one. (This can cause you to save non-POSIX text files.)
#set nonewlines

#    Deprecated option since it has become the default setting. When needed, use unset breaklonglines instead.
#set nowrap

#    Use this color combination for line numbers. See set functioncolor for valid color names.
#set numbercolor [bold,][italic,]fgcolor,bgcolor

#    nano will only read and write files inside "directory" and its subdirectories. Also, the current directory is changed to here, so files are inserted from this directory. By default, the operating directory feature is turned off.
#set operatingdir "directory"

#    Save the cursor position of files between editing sessions. The cursor position is remembered for the 200 most-recently edited files.
#set positionlog

#    Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).
#set preserve

#    Use this color combination for the prompt bar. (When this option is not specified, the colors of the title bar are used.) See set functioncolor for valid color names.
#set promptcolor [bold,][italic,]fgcolor,bgcolor

#    Set the characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying paragraphs. This may not include blank characters. Only the specified closing punctuation, optionally followed by closing brackets (see set brackets), can end sentences. The default value is "!.?".
#set punct "characters"

#    Make status-bar messages disappear after 1 keystroke instead of after 20. Note that options constantshow and minibar override this.
#set quickblank

#    Set the regular expression for matching the quoting part of a line. The default value is "^([ \t]*([!#%:;>|}]|//))+". (Note that \t stands for a literal Tab character.) This makes it possible to rejustify blocks of quoted 
#      text when composing email, and to rewrap blocks of line comments when writing source code.
#set quotestr "regex"

#    Interpret escape sequences directly (instead of asking ncurses to translate them). If you need this option to get your keyboard to work properly, please report a bug. Using this option disables nano’s mouse support.
#set rawsequences

#    Interpret the Delete and Backspace keys differently so that both Backspace and Delete work properly. You should only use this option when on your system either Backspace acts like Delete or Delete acts like Backspace.
#set rebinddelete

#    Do regular-expression searches by default. Regular expressions in nano are of the extended type (ERE).
#set regexp

#    Save a changed buffer automatically on exit (^X); don’t prompt. (The old form of this option, set tempfile, is deprecated.)
#set saveonexit

#    Use this color combination for the indicator alias "scrollbar". (On terminal emulators that link to a libvte older than version 0.55, using a background color here does not work correctly.) See set functioncolor for valid color names.
#set scrollercolor fgcolor,bgcolor

#    Use this color combination for selected text. See set functioncolor for valid color names.
#set selectedcolor [bold,][italic,]fgcolor,bgcolor

#    Use this color combination for selected text. See set functioncolor for valid color names.
#      Put the cursor on the highlighted item in the file browser, and show the cursor in the help viewer, to aid braille users and people with poor vision.
#set showcursor

#    Make the Home key smarter. When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).
#      If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the line.
set smarthome

#    Display lines that exceed the screen’s width over multiple screen lines. (You can make this soft-wrapping occur at whitespace instead of rudely at the screen’s edge, by using also set atblanks.)
set softwrap

#    Use the given program to do spell checking and correcting. See --speller for details.
#set speller "program [argument …]"

#    Use this color combination for highlighting a search match. The default value is black,lightyellow. See set functioncolor for valid color names.
#set spotlightcolor [bold,][italic,]fgcolor,bgcolor

#    Use the top-right corner of the screen for showing some state flags: I when auto-indenting, M when the mark is on, L when hard-wrapping (breaking long lines), R when recording a macro, and S when soft-wrapping. When the buffer is modified, a star (*) is shown after the filename in the center of the title bar.
#set stateflags

#    Set the two characters used to indicate the presence of tabs and spaces. They must be single-column characters. The default pair for a UTF-8 locale is "»·", and for other locales ">.".
#set whitespace "characters"

#    Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation characters as part of a word.
#set wordbounds

#    Specify which other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric ones) should be considered as parts of words. When using this option, you probably want to unset wordbounds.
#set wordchars "characters"

#    Let an unmodified Backspace or Delete erase the marked region (instead of a single character, and without affecting the cutbuffer).
